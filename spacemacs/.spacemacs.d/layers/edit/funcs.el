  "My untabify function as discussed and described at
 http://www.jwz.org/doc/tabs-vs-spaces.html
 and improved by Claus Brunzema:
 - return nil to get `write-contents-hooks' to work correctly
   (see documentation there)
 - `make-local-hook' instead of `make-local-variable'
 - when instead of if
 Use some lines along the following for getting this to work in the
 modes you want it to:

 \(add-hook 'some-mode-hook
           '(lambda ()
               (make-local-hook 'write-contents-hooks)
                (add-hook 'write-contents-hooks 'ska-untabify nil t)))"
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (when (search-forward "\t" nil t)
      (untabify (1- (point)) (point-max)))
    nil))
